Cashish
=======

Storing Currency as Integers
Cashish (will) make it easy to display this with the right number of decimal places.
As well as creating a simple "Amount" object you can perform arithmetic on.

Example
=======

    gbp = Cashish::Amount.new(1_000_000_00, "GBP")
    
    gbp.to_s
    => "1,000,000.00 GBP"
    
    gbp.to_f
    => 1_000_000.00
    
    gbp.to_s(:simple)
    => "1000000.00"
